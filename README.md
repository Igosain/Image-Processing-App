Image Processing and KNN Image Classification
Overview
This project encompasses an advanced suite for image processing alongside a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) image classification system, designed as a comprehensive tool for manipulating images and classifying them based on learned patterns. Developed using Python, it integrates various image processing techniques such as color adjustment, rotation, blurring, and edge detection, and features a from-scratch implementation of a KNN classifier.

Features
Image Processing: Offers a variety of image manipulation techniques, including negation, grayscale conversion, 180-degree rotation, brightness adjustment, and blurring.
Image Classification: Implements a KNN classifier capable of categorizing images into predefined classes based on similarity to training data.
File Operations: Utilizes the PIL library to read from and write to image files, facilitating easy conversion between image formats and internal representation.
Extensive Documentation: Each module and function is thoroughly documented, providing clear guidance on usage and functionality.
Robust Testing: Includes a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure reliability and accuracy of both the image processing functions and the KNN classifier.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
NumPy
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>
Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.
Install the required Python packages:
pip install numpy pillow
Running the Application
To use the image processing tools or run the KNN classifier, navigate to the project directory and execute the desired scripts. For example:
python image_processor.py
